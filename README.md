# Dictionary coding: LZ77, LZ78, LZSS, LZW

## About

This little project is product of a class assignment, coded around May 2016.

It was used to study the dictionary encoding methods LZ77, LZ78, LZSS and LZW.

## Structure
It is composed by only seven files, one for each encoding (LZ77, LZ78, LZSS and LZW), one manager, the Utils which
has methods used in not only one encoding method and the __main.py__, that allows an easy execution.


## How it works
You can read about each dictionary encoding in the following wikipedia entries:

* [LZ77 and LZ78](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78).
* [LZSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Stac)
* [LZW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch)


## Usage
You can test quickly each coding executing __main.py__ and providing it with a source file.
